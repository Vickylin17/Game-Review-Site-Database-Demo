# Game-Review-Site-Database-Demo

This project is designed to develop a dedicated video game review database within the gaming industry.
It aims to compile and streamline reviews from both critics and gaming community, offering a
comprehensive platform for players to access insights and feedback on a broad spectrum of video
games.


Due to time constraints, we only created a simple demo page and implemented some basic functions:

➢ Users can create new accounts on the game review site;
➢ Users can log in using email and password to view the basic account information;
➢ Users can delete their comments to the games by entering the corresponding comment id;
➢ Users can update their account information including email, username, password, and age;
➢ Users can filter and view the game based on genre, released year, and price;
➢ Users can view all game information and can choose single or multiple columns of the game
information, for instance, users can view the combination of game + price, game + released year,
and so on;
➢ Users can click on the join button to see all comments with related games and related
usernames;
➢ Users can click on the show count button to view the number of news written by each press
(corresponding to Aggregation with Group By);
➢ Users can click on the highest rating button to view the highest rating of each game only for
those games having more than one rating (comment) (corresponding to Aggregation with
Having);
➢ Users can click on the highest average rating button to view the game with the highest average
rating (corresponding to Nested Aggregation with Group By);
➢ Users can click on the division button to view the users who have commented on all games
(corresponding to Division).


As shown, the functions are very basic, and additional functions could be implemented to realize the
actual game review site. In this project, we only present a basic idea of the game review site.
